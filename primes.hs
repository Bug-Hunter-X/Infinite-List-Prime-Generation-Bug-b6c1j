This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite lists. The function `primes` attempts to generate an infinite list of prime numbers, but the `filter` operation does not terminate when it encounters a non-prime number. This leads to non-termination when trying to access an element beyond a certain point.
